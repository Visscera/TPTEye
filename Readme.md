I've cobbled this tool together in a couple of hours. Simple, but handy.
Bug reports are welcome, though I find it hard imagine what could possibly break there.

Provides convenient interface for manipulating separate bits of light-related particles in The Powder Toy - PHOTons, FILTers, BRAYs and such.
Click on the separate bits to flip them, drag along the bits to flip batches.
